# Recipe Page - Frontend Mentor

This is my solution to the [Recipe Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm) challenge from Frontend Mentor. The goal was to build a recipe page following a given design, focusing on HTML semantics, responsiveness, and good CSS practices.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- HTML5 Semantics

- **Desktop First** methodology
- CSS Variables for colors and typography
- **Google Fonts** (Inter font family)
- Responsive Design

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Fully responsive page
- Correct use of semantic tags (`section`, `article`, `ul`, `ol`, `table`)
- Optimized styles and organized code
- Basic accessibility improvements (e.g., proper heading structure, use of lists)
